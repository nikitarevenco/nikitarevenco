Hi there! Here are some of my projects:
- [`blog`](https://github.com/nikitarevenco/blog): My MDX-powered blog where I post interesting stuff (currently unreleased)
- [`eslint-config-nikitarevenco`](https://github.com/nikitarevenco/eslint-config-nikitarevenco): I use this eslint config in all of my personal projects, it's super strict with 100s of rules because I like to maintain consistent code bases
- [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/nikitarevenco/dotfiles): I keep them purposefully minimal, includes my neovim, i3, wezterm configs etc. (also windows-compatible!)
- [`remark-semantic-blockquotes`](https://github.com/nikitarevenco/remark-semantic-blockquotes): extends markdown syntax to add an easy way to give credit to the source
