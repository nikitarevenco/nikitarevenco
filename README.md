Hi there! Here are some of my projects:
- `blog`: My MDX-powered blog where I post interesting stuff (currently unreleased)
- `eslint-config-nikitarevenco`: I use this eslint config in all of my personal projects, it's super strict with 100s of rules because I like to maintain extremely consistent code basest
- `dotfiles`: I keep them purposefully minimal, includes my neovim, i3, wezterm configs etc. (also windows-compatible!)
- `remark-semantic-blockquotes`: extends markdown syntax to add an easy way to give credit to the source
